# Hi! I'm Alfredo 
### (kurodaSensei is my programmer's nickname xD)

I'm an all-around technology enthusiast web developer interested in leading teams and creating web applications that help other people grow or simply make an aspect of their lives easier.

Currently, I'm in Bogota and I'm part of the CDI Interactive team to develop the best web solutions for people.
